👋 Hi, I’m @mezSF ((which means SouthFlorida not SanFran), born in Queens NY and escaped Before Covid)😎
👀 My most used language is ...PowerShell, and then Python, Bash, and slowly learning Javascript and other Web or Windows Application Languages.
🌱 I’m currently working on how to convince those with the power to destroy the future, to wake up and join the critical thinkers and enlightened humans before they lead the human race into an endless spiral of destruction.  This is not an easy task, and it's especially difficult because humans are getting stupider and stupider as the machines lead us to the idiocracy. We need to form a massive group of intelligent humans, that are not rich, or political, just care about the future of humanity and somehow can come together to make breakthroughs in Physics, Free Energy, and how to rescue our children from the impending idiocracy.
Software is not being created to improve our intelligence, it only diminishes it.  We are in the midst of a very Dark Age, and the more we continue down this path, the worse off we will be.  WAKE UP People! Time to learn, not consume.  Contact me and let's save the world.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .. media projects, audio, video, documentation, planning and educating all.
